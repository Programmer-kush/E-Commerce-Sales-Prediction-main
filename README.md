# E-Commerce Sales Prediction

A comprehensive project focused on predicting sales in an e-commerce context through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and data visualization.

## Description

This project aims to analyze and predict sales trends in an e-commerce dataset. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualizing sales data to identify top-selling products.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**
  - Loads the dataset and removes entries with missing CustomerID.
  - Handles duplicate StockCode entries and encodes categorical variables using LabelEncoder.

- **Data Filtering**
  - Removes short StockCode values (less than 5 characters) and negative Quantity values indicating returns.

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Adds new columns: CancelledOrder, InternationalOrders, and computes Sales as Quantity * UnitPrice.

- **Visualization & Analysis**
  - Identifies and visualizes the top 10 products by sales using a bar chart for sales trend analysis.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/E-Commerce-Sales-Prediction.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd E-Commerce-Sales-Prediction

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure you have the dataset file (e.g., data.csv) in the data directory
```

## Usage

1. Run the script to process the data and generate visualizations:

```python
python sales_prediction.py
```

2. The script will generate a bar chart showing the top 10 products by sales.

## Technologies Used

- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning tasks
  - `labelencoder` for categorical variable encoding

- **Tools:**
  - Python 3.x
  - Jupyter Notebook (optional for exploration)
